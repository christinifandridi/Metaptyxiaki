< control problem for oil recovery optimization. This includes partial and sometimes heuristic approaches, valid for particular types of constraints \cite{Brouwer:2004,VanEssen,Virnovski,Wang:2009}, and more systematic approaches, valid for a broader range of constraint equations \cite{Chen:2010,Montleau,Kraaijevanger,Pallav:2008,Suwartadi:2012}. An important feature in simulations involving highly compressible fluids, which we have in the systems considered here since we inject gas, is the occurrence of transient peaks in the rate in response to changes in well bottom-hole pressure. These transient effects impact simulation results in our models because they occur over time scales that are larger than a time step (this is in contrast to nearly incompressible systems, where this type of transient decays very quickly and is not resolved by the simulator). These transient effects lead to challenges in constrained optimization of compositional systems, because rate constraints can be easily violated. Here we will present and assess both a formal constraint handling approach and a simpler heuristic procedure for satisfying rate constraints, which can be used in compressible systems.

< In the results below, we apply this treatment and compare it to the formal approach described in Section~\ref{sec:constr-opt}. Using this procedure, which we refer to as `heuristic constraint handling', we first perform the optimization without including the nonlinear constraints. Bound (linear) constraints are honored during the optimization. Then, after this initial optimization has converged, we run the forward problem once more using the `optimized' BHPs, but this time the simulator is allowed to switch to rate control when required to satisfy the nonlinear constraints. Thus the computational effort for this approach is little more than that required for optimizing the bound (and linearly) constrained problem, as just one additional simulation run is performed.
< 
< 
< In our implementation of the heuristic constraint handling procedure, we also allow wells to switch back to BHP control (after they have switched from BHP control to rate control). The switch in control is accomplished, in either case, by checking (at each Newton iteration) to see if the current active control is violated. This assessment can be performed efficiently through use of the well equation. If the well does switch back to BHP control, it remains on BHP control unless (and until) the rate constraint is again violated. This process generally increases the number of Newton iterations required for convergence, though in most of the cases considered the total simulation time is within a factor of two of that for a typical forward simulation run (and, as noted above, the run using heuristic constraint handling is only performed once).
