\chapter*{Abstract}
The optimization of oil production is a tedious and computationally intensive 
process that requires the solution of time dependent nonlinear set of partial 
differential equations describing the flow of hydrocarbons in anisotropic porous 
media. Optimization of production is usually performed using either gradient 
free techniques like genetic algorithms, particle swarm algorithms, or 
gradient-based techniques where the gradients are computed through the solution 
of the adjoint problem. A gradient-based optimization method, in which the 
gradient is computed using an adjoint formulation, is often the method of choice 
since in contrast to numerical perturbation techniques that require as many 
objective function evaluations as the number of control parameters, the gradient 
using adjoint-based techniques is obtained  only at a small fraction of the time 
spent for the evaluation of the objective function. The production optimisation 
problem is usually subject to industrial constraints, for example, maximum gas 
rate specification in injection or production wells, when the control variables 
are well bottom-hole pressures. At the same time optimising  time-varying well 
settings, such as injection rates, production rates or bottom-hole pressures, is 
an important aspect of optimal reservoir management that increases significantly 
the dimension of the search space. It is well known that for non-convex 
optimisation problems, gradient-based techniques are likely to get trapped in poor 
local optima. A common practise is to lunch several independent optimisation runs
from different initial guesses or to combine ideas from gradient-free algorithms 
with gradient-based to benefit from the merits of both. An adequate sampling of 
the search space would require an intractable number of simulations and it is 
thus impossible.

The aim of this work is to exploit an observation in homogeneous reservoirs, 
where the global optimum, when optimising cumulative oil recovery,  is usually 
achieved from any initial guess. We perform continuation with 
respect to a parameter that transforms the homogenous reservoir with respect to 
porosity and permeability, to the current one, solving an optimal control 
problem for each distinct value of the parameter, where the objective function 
now is defined to be the misfit between a subset of the states of the two 
problems. The proposed technique is tested in several examples of increased 
complexity.
